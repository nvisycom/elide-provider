# Elide Provider

**Inference services implementing Elide's recognizer contracts.**

Self-hosted NER, OCR, and speech models behind one wire contract, with a
Rust client that speaks it.

</div>

A workspace pairing BentoML-hosted Python model services with Rust client
crates that speak their wire contract. Any
[Elide](https://github.com/nvisycom/elide) consumer, including the
[Elide Runtime](https://github.com/nvisycom/elide-runtime) engine, drops these
in as its `NerBackend`, `OcrBackend`, or `SttBackend` implementation. The
Python side ships as Docker containers deployed as sidecars; the Rust side is
a library crate the consumer embeds directly.

## Services

**[bento-gliner2](packages/bento-gliner2)**  
Schema-driven NER and PII detection, so the labels to find are named per call rather than baked into the model.

**[bento-doctr](packages/bento-doctr)**  
The default OCR service, wrapping docTR.

**[bento-paddleocr](packages/bento-paddleocr)**  
Vision-language OCR verification, for text docTR reads with low confidence.

**[bento-whisper](packages/bento-whisper)**  
Speech-to-text, so audio reaches the same detection pipeline as text.

## Clients

**[elide-bentoml](crates/elide-bentoml)**  
The Rust client for the services above, feature-gated per backend (`ner`, `ocr`, `stt`).

**[elide-deepgram](crates/elide-deepgram)**  
A Deepgram-backed speech-to-text backend, for hosted transcription instead of
self-hosted Whisper.

**[elide-pioneer](crates/elide-pioneer)**  
A Pioneer-backed NER backend, running the same GLiNER2 model family as
`bento-gliner2` without self-hosting it.

## Contract

**[bento-core](packages/bento-core)**  
The wire-contract types the services share. Not a service itself: no
`bentofile.yaml`, no serve target, just the shapes both sides agree on.

The Rust client speaks each service through that contract, not the model behind
it. Any HTTP service reproducing the `/recognize` (NER, OCR, VL) or
`/transcribe` (STT) contract is a drop-in replacement for the shipped packages,
including self-hosted or custom models and weights. Each package README
documents its wire shape.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with [Nvisy Cloud](https://nvisy.com).

For self-hosted use, build and run each service with:

```bash
make sync             # install workspace deps
make serve-gliner2    # or serve-doctr, serve-paddleocr, serve-whisper
```

or build the Docker images:

```bash
make build           # every service
make build-image     # build + containerize
```
