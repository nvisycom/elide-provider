Pioneer (Fastino) GLiNER2-backed NER backend for elide.

## Overview

A `NerBackend` over [Pioneer](https://pioneer.ai)'s hosted GLiNER2 API —
the same model family the self-hosted
[`bento-gliner2`](../../packages/bento-gliner2) service runs locally, so
the two are directly comparable. A sibling to
[`elide-bentoml`](../elide-bentoml), not a part of it: both implement the
same trait, so a deployment picks one without either knowing about the
other.

Pioneer publishes no Rust SDK, so this speaks to `POST /gliner-2`
directly over `reqwest`: one request, `X-API-Key` for auth, and a JSON
body carrying the text, the labels to extract, and a confidence
threshold. `include_confidence` and `include_spans` are always set —
without them the response carries neither a score nor an offset, which
are exactly what a `NerSpan` is made of.

Labels arrive per call, so extraction is zero-shot: any label the caller
names is extracted, not a fixed taxonomy. elide's `Label` can carry a
natural-language description to steer a zero-shot model, but Pioneer's
wire schema is a list of bare names with no slot for one, so descriptions
are dropped.

**Offsets are converted, not copied.** Pioneer reports *character*
positions; `NerSpan::offset` is a byte range into the source string. The
two coincide only for ASCII, so a document containing an accented name
would otherwise have every following span silently shifted — in a
redaction pipeline, redacting the wrong bytes. A span that does not
resolve against the submitted text, or whose length disagrees with the
matched text Pioneer echoes back, is dropped rather than repaired.

## Before pointing this at production text

**This sends the text to be scanned to a third party** — for a redaction
pipeline, the un-redacted original. The self-hosted `bento-gliner2`
service runs the same open-weight model
(`fastino/gliner2-privacy-filter-PII-multi`, Apache-2.0) with no egress,
so this backend buys convenience rather than capability.

Pioneer's own published terms make that a live concern. As of September
2026, from their Trust & Safety documentation:

| | |
|---|---|
| Retention | Indefinite by default. A zero-retention mode exists but is scoped to "eligible use cases", which are not enumerated. |
| Training | On by default. Opting out requires a paid plan, and their documentation states that "continuous adaptation and remediation training of your own task models" continues regardless. |
| DPA | Not offered — stated as a current non-offering, not a sales question. |
| SOC 2 / ISO 27001 | Both "in progress"; first audit expected around November 2026. |
| HIPAA | No BAA documented at any tier. |
| Sub-processors | 15, all US-based. The list includes OpenAI and Anthropic for "AI/ML services"; whether GLiNER2 calls specifically stay off that path is not documented. |

There is, on the published terms, no way to stop submitted text from
training something. For a de-identification product that is a decision to
take deliberately, not a default to inherit — and the terms are worth
confirming directly rather than from this table, which will age.

An enterprise VPC deployment is mentioned in their materials but is
sales-gated and undocumented. Since the model weights are already
Apache-2.0 on Hugging Face, that is the variant worth asking about: it
would make this backend a genuine alternative rather than a trade.

## Two known API quirks

The `gliner2` Python client still hardcodes `https://api.fastino.ai`,
whose TLS certificate expired in October 2025. The live endpoint is
`https://api.pioneer.ai`, which is what this crate defaults to.

Pioneer's docs show GLiNER2 called through an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions` route with `model: "fastino/gliner2-large-v1"`,
but that model does not appear in a live `GET /v1/models` listing. This
crate uses the dedicated `/gliner-2` route, which is what their own
Python client calls and what their OpenAPI spec types.
